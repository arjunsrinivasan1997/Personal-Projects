Hello ${PERSON_NAME}!

My name is ${Sender_Name}. I wanted to get in touch because Iâ€™ve been reading your ${TYPE_OF_MEDIA} and love ${Personal_Message}. I am reaching out to you today to tell you about Cuddle Cub.
Cuddle Cub is a product that we are co-creating with parents that aids parents in:

    1. Educating children about the importance of sleep.
    2. Instilling a bedtime routine in children to ease them into a restful sleep.
    3. Forming healthy sleep habits with and for their children.
    4. Tracking sleep to provide actionable data that empowers parents to make informed day to day decisions for their children.
    5. Keeping a historical record of sleep data to provide to pediatricians should any reason/concern arise.

We are running a promotional giveaway campaign to spread the word about Cuddle Cub prior to our official launch. I am wondering if you would be willing to promote our giveaway and website on your blog. It would mean the world to us, as getting the word out to parents helps with the product feedback and design and we believe that parents should be the primary designers of Cuddle Cub.

Thank you so much for your time! I look forward to speaking with you and hearing your opinion.

Please find our giveaway and company information at www.cuddlecub.us and our product idea information at www.cuddle-cub.com

To a future full of restful sleep,
${Sender_Name} and CC Team
