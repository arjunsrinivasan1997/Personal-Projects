My partner and I had everything done in this project except for column operations and aliasing by the Friday before the due date. However, implementing aliasing and column expressions took up all of our time until Monday, where we had a project that was over 100 points. However, we both decided we wanted all of the gold points possible so Monday night and Tuesday morning were spent implementing NaN and NOVALUE into our database.
